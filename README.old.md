# Spin the Wheel - Technical Analysis Report

## Application Overview
The implemented "Spin the Wheel" game is a React-based web application that offers an interactive spinning wheel experience. Players can spin the wheel up to 5 times, accumulating points based on where the wheel stops, with the goal of achieving the highest possible total score.

## Architecture Design

### Component Structure
The application follows a modular component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

1. **App Component (App.js)**
   - Serves as the main container component
   - Manages the global game state
   - Coordinates communication between child components
   - Handles core game logic and state management

2. **Main Components Referenced**
   - Wheel: Handles the visual wheel and spinning animation
   - ScoreBoard: Displays game statistics and history
   - SpinButton: Controls game interaction

### State Management
The application uses React's useState hook to manage three primary state variables:
- `scores`: Array tracking the history of spins
- `isSpinning`: Boolean controlling the wheel's animation state
- `currentScore`: Number representing the most recent spin result

## Game Logic Implementation

### Core Mechanics

1. **Spin Initialization**
```javascript
const handleSpin = () => {
    if (scores.length >= 5 || isSpinning) return;
    setIsSpinning(true);
    const spinDegrees = 720 + Math.random() * 720;
    // ...
}
```
- Prevents spinning when 5 spins are completed or wheel is in motion
- Generates random rotation between 720째 and 1440째 (2-4 full rotations)

2. **Score Calculation**
```javascript
const calculateScore = (degree) => {
    const slice = Math.floor((360 - degree) / 36);
    return (slice + 1) * 10;
}
```
- Converts final wheel position to score
- Each slice represents 36째 (360째 / 10 slices)
- Scores range from 10 to 100 in increments of 10

3. **Game State Management**
- Maximum of 5 spins per game session
- Maintains history of all spins
- Automatic score accumulation
- Reset functionality to start new game

### Visual Design Implementation

1. **Wheel Visualization**
- 10 equal slices with alternating colors
- Scores displayed on each slice
- Pointer indicator at top
- Smooth rotation animation

2. **Score Display**
- Current spin result
- Running total of all spins
- History of previous spins
- Remaining spins counter

### User Interface Elements

1. **Interactive Controls**
- Spin button (disabled during animation)
- Reset button for new game
- Visual feedback during spinning
- Clear score display

2. **Responsive Design**
- Flexible layout using CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-friendly component sizing
- Consistent spacing and alignment

## Technical Considerations

### Animation Implementation
- CSS transitions for smooth wheel rotation
- 8-second spin duration
- Dynamic degree calculation for realistic motion
- Proper state management during animation

### State Updates
- Asynchronous handling of spin completion
- Atomic state updates to prevent race conditions
- Clear state reset functionality

### Error Prevention
- Disabled controls during animation
- Spin limit enforcement
- Proper game state validation

## Performance Optimizations
1. **State Management**
- Minimal state updates
- Efficient score calculation
- Optimized render cycles

2. **Animation Performance**
- CSS transform for smooth rotation
- Hardware acceleration support
- Efficient transition handling

## Conclusion
The implemented solution successfully meets all specified requirements while maintaining clean code architecture and smooth user experience. The modular design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements while ensuring reliable game mechanics and engaging user interaction.
